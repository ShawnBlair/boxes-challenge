# The Boxes Challenge

## About the Project

This is a program that involves <b>boxes</b> and it is <b>responsive!</b>. Not much will be disclosed about this project because it takes the 'it's better to try out first in order to find out' route. <b>Just click a box, click it again or click another one!</b> Alright, I've said enough about the project. It's time for you to sample it...  :)
